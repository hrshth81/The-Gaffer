# 🏟️ The Gaffer

> **"Tactics win games, but vibes win seasons."**

**The Gaffer** is a football-themed productivity app that turns your boring academic semester into a high-stakes league campaign. Built entirely via **Vibe Coding**, this project focuses on rapid prototyping, clean UI, and peak competitive energy.

## ⚽ The Vibe
Traditional to-do apps are a drag. **The Gaffer** treats your life like a Premier League season. 
- **Tasks = Fixtures.**
- **Checking a box = Scoring a Goal.**
- **Top of the Table = Legend.**
- **Bottom of the Table = VAR Punishment.**

## 🚀 Features (All Vibe, No Fluff)
- **The Technical Area:** Quick signup and simple league creation. Just share a code with your mates and the season starts.
- **The Golden Boot Race:** Shared assignments are "Common Fixtures." First one to upload the solution gets the most points. Speed is everything.
- **Matchweeks:** A 7-day sprint where the table resets. Sunday night is "Final Whistle" time.
- **VAR Reviews:** If you're bottom of the league, be ready. Your friends pick a football-themed penalty (paying for the post-game drinks, running laps, etc.).
- **Goal Celebrations:** Hit your targets and trigger animations like the "Siu" or a knee slide. Miss a deadline? You’re getting a **Red Card.**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Font:** Inter / Open Sans (Clean, minimalist, professional).
- **Vibe:** Minimalist "Dressing Room" aesthetic.
- **Stack:** Built using AI-driven logic and modern web tools for maximum speed and "get-it-done" energy.

## 🏆 The Rulebook
1. **Join a League:** Sign up, enter your name, and hop into a league with your friends.
2. **Score Goals:** Complete your tasks. The harder the task, the more points you get.
3. **Finish First:** Beat your friends to the finish line on common assignments to claim the top spot.
4. **Avoid the Drop:** Stay out of the relegation zone unless you want to face the weekly punishment.
